openHop Core is a Python implementation of the MeshCore protocol. It provides the
wire-format, cryptography, identity, routing, asynchronous node, companion, and
radio layers used by openHop Repeater and other Python mesh applications.

The library preserves compatibility with MeshCore firmware while supporting more
than direct SPI radios: applications can use SX1262 hardware, KISS serial modems,
and openHop Modems over USB or TCP. A WebSocket implementation also exists but
should be treated as experimental against the current dispatcher contract.

## What this section covers

- Installation and safe lifecycle patterns
- Protocol, node, companion, and radio architecture
- Practical node usage, current examples, and hardware safety
- Direct SX1262 and KISS modem compatibility
- Public API entry points, development, and tests
