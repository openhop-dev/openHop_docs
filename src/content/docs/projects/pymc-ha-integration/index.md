Welcome to the docs for the `openHop Repeater` Home Assistant integration.

This integration connects Home Assistant directly to a local `openhop_repeater` instance, creates a dedicated API token during setup, and exposes repeater telemetry, MQTT broker state, control entities, and advanced service actions inside Home Assistant.
