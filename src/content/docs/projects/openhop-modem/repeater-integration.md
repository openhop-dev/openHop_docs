# openHop Modem Repeater Integration

openHop Repeater can use an openHop Modem in three related ways:

1. As the RF transport with `radio_type: pymc_usb` or `radio_type: pymc_tcp`.
2. As a sensor source with `type: pymc_modem` under `sensors.definitions`.
3. As the native GPS source with `gps.source: modem_http`.

These are intentionally separate. For example, a TCP modem can carry packets on port `5055` while Repeater also polls `http://<modem-host>/api/stats` for battery, solar, and GPS diagnostics.

## Select the modem as Repeater's radio

Edit `/etc/pymc_repeater/config.yaml` and set the top-level `radio_type`.

### USB-CDC modem

Use this when the modem is plugged directly into the Repeater host.

```yaml
radio_type: pymc_usb

pymc_usb:
  port: "/dev/ttyACM0"
  baudrate: 921600
  lbt_enabled: true
  lbt_max_attempts: 5
```

If your board appears as `/dev/ttyUSB0`, use that instead.

### LAN TCP modem

Use this when the modem is reachable over Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

```yaml
radio_type: pymc_tcp

pymc_tcp:
  host: "pymc-modem.local"
  port: 5055
  token: ""
  connect_timeout: 5.0
  lbt_enabled: true
  lbt_max_attempts: 5
```

Replace `pymc-modem.local` with the modem's mDNS hostname or LAN IP. The TCP token is the modem protocol token, not the HTTP Basic Auth password. Leave it empty only on a trusted LAN when the modem is configured that way.

## Keep radio settings aligned

The modem owns the physical SX1262 interface, but Repeater still sends the radio configuration it wants to use. Keep these values aligned with the mesh network:

```yaml
radio:
  frequency: 869618000
  tx_power: 22
  bandwidth: 62500
  spreading_factor: 11
  coding_rate: 5
  preamble_length: 16
```

## Add the modem sensor

The `pymc_modem` sensor polls the modem HTTP `/api/stats` endpoint and exposes diagnostics under Repeater's `/api/stats -> sensors` output.

Use it for modem-visible data such as:

- GPS enabled/seen state
- GPS fix status
- latitude, longitude, altitude
- satellites used and in view
- UTC date/time
- speed and course
- battery voltage and derived battery percent
- solar charge rate when the modem exposes it

Example:

```yaml
sensors:
  enabled: true
  poll_interval_seconds: 10.0
  definitions:
    - type: hardware_stats
      name: system-health
      enabled: true

    - type: pymc_modem
      name: modem
      enabled: true
      settings:
        host: "pymc-modem.local"
        port: 80
        endpoint: "/api/stats"
        scheme: "http"
        username: "admin"
        password: "password"
        poll_interval_seconds: 60.0
        timeout_seconds: 2.0
```

Notes:

- Use the modem HTTP password here, not the Repeater dashboard password.
- Set `password: ""` only if the modem HTTP API is intentionally unauthenticated.
- Keep `poll_interval_seconds` around `60.0` for modem telemetry so stats polling does not contend with packet transport or GPS polling on weak Wi-Fi.
- The sensor is diagnostics only. It does not make Repeater's native `/api/gps` endpoint GPS-enabled by itself.

## Use the modem as native Repeater GPS

Use `gps.source: modem_http` when you want Repeater's native GPS subsystem to use the modem's parsed GPS payload. This powers `/api/gps`, `/api/stats -> gps`, GPS diagnostics, optional GPS adverts, and optional config persistence.

Example:

```yaml
gps:
  enabled: true
  source: modem_http
  host: "pymc-modem.local"
  port: 80
  endpoint: "/api/stats"
  scheme: "http"
  username: "admin"
  password: "password"
  poll_interval_seconds: 2.0

  api_fallback_to_config_location: true
  advertise_gps_location: false
  persist_gps_fix_to_config: false
  stale_after_seconds: 10.0
  retain_sentences: 25
```

Supported source aliases are:

- `modem_http`
- `pymc_modem`
- `http`

Prefer `modem_http` in new configs because it describes the integration boundary rather than one board.

## Sensor vs GPS source

| Config | Endpoint affected | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sensors.definitions[].type: pymc_modem` | `/api/stats -> sensors` | Diagnostics and telemetry cards. |
| `gps.source: modem_http` | `/api/gps` and `/api/stats -> gps` | Native Repeater GPS location, fix, satellite diagnostics, and optional GPS adverts. |

For a GPS-capable modem, it is normal to enable both. Use the sensor for battery/solar/modem diagnostics and use `modem_http` GPS for Repeater's own location model.

## Restart and verify

After editing the config:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart pymc-repeater
sudo journalctl -u pymc-repeater -f
```

Check the modem HTTP API directly from the Repeater host:

```bash
curl -u admin:password http://pymc-modem.local/api/stats
```

Check Repeater's API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/stats
curl http://localhost:8000/api/gps
```

Look for:

- successful `pymc_usb` or `pymc_tcp` modem connection in logs
- no serial permission errors for USB mode
- no placeholder host or DNS errors for TCP mode
- a `modem` sensor entry under `/api/stats -> sensors`
- GPS `source` showing modem HTTP when `gps.source: modem_http` is enabled
- satellite `in_view` records with azimuth/elevation/SNR when the modem exposes them
